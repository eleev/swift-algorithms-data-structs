### If you like the project, please give it a star ‚≠ê It will show the creator your appreciation and help others to discover the repo.

# ‚úçÔ∏è About 
The repository contains examples of common `Algorithms` and `Data Structures` implemented using the latest stable version of `Swift`programming language. The development attempts to fully utilize `Standard Library` and `Protocol-Oriented` paradigm. The project provides interactive visualizations using `SpriteKit` and `SceneKit` frameworks (in development).

## üìö Content 
Each major section will be wrapped into a separete `.playground` file, meaning that `data structures` and `algorithms` will be separeted for convenient management. :octocat:

# üì∫ Interactive Visualizations
The following list contains interactive visualizations that were implemented as part of the project. In majority of cases you can interact with a `data structure` or `algorithm` through a number of `UI` controlls. Visualizations are implemented using `SpriteKit` framework and are intended to explain the work of `data structures` and `algorithms` in a more highlevel way, which is a great way to learn especially if you are a beginner or you aren't familiar with something listed in the repository. 

## Stack 
Stack visalization has two main UI controlls: `push` and `pop`. They perform corresponding operations: adding a new book at the top of the stack and removing the top book from the stack. Also there is a label that shows how many books are in the stack. Since the screen size is limited and for the sake of simplicity, the number of books in stack is limited.

## Queue
Queue visualization is similar to Stack interactive visualization: it has two main `UI` controls that allow you to interact with the interface of the `Queue` data structure for `enqueue` and `dequeue` operations. You can see the number of animals in the queue as well.
